											</header>
											<p>Summertime is the busiest time in the year for travelers.

												<h3><a href="#">No Compensation in the United States</a></h3>
											</header>
											<p> In the United States, passengers are not entitled to compensation when a delay occurs. Airlines are required to pay for lodging costs of passengers if the delay or a cancellation is through their own fault, but not if the cause is beyond their control, such as weather.<br></br></p>

												<h3><a href="#">Departure or Arrival Delay?</a></h3>
											</header>
											<p>From data visualization, we can infer that delays at arrival are generally lower than at departure. This indicates that airlines adjust their flight speed in order to reduce the delays at arrival. While all mean delays are around 10 minutes, we see that occasionally, we can face really large delays that can reach a few tens of hours!</p>

												<h3><a href="#">Heat Makes It Harder to Fly</a></h3>
											</header>
											<p>It’s actually harder for planes to fly in hot air because the air itself becomes much less dense. Sparser air molecules means the plane’s wings generate less lift, making takeoff more difficult.<br></br><br></br></p>

												<h3><a href="#">Pulvinar sagittis congue</a></h3>
											</header>
											<p> there is a high variability in average delays, both between the different airports but also between the different airlines. This is important because it implies that in order to accurately model the delays, it will be necessary to adopt a model that is specific to the company and the home airport The air system delay is around 20~30% of all the delays, with Spirit Airlines being the most dominant factor and Hawaiian Airlines only 1.8%. Some other factors such as security issues and shortage of staff </p>

												<h3><a href="#">Airline Delays</a></h3>
											</header>
											<p>
											    The late aircraft delay consists of almost one third of the delays accross all airlines, with the Southwest Airlines being half of delays. The airline delay consists of 25~33% of all the delays, with Hawaiian Airlines the factor is the 58% of all the delays. Other delays due to maintenance problems with the aircraft and fueling are also common.</p>
